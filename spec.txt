Build a Python pipeline that scrapes structured faculty data from the GW Law full-time faculty directory and automatically generates an Anki flashcard deck (.apkg) with photo-front cards.

Functional specification:
	1.	Input: Public web pages at https://www.law.gwu.edu/full-time-faculty and linked faculty profile pages.
	2.	Extraction:
	•	From directory pages: faculty name, title, photo URL, and profile URL.
	•	From individual profiles: biography text and most recent publication entries (≤3).
	3.	Data handling:
	•	Normalize text, download headshots to a media/ folder, and log incomplete records.
	•	Respect robots.txt and throttle requests.
	4.	Output:
	•	For each faculty member, create one Anki card:
	•	Front: photo only
	•	Back: name, title, bio, and latest publications list
	•	Export both gwlaw_faculty.csv (for manual import) and gwlaw_faculty.apkg (ready-to-use deck).
	5.	Libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, genanki, hashlib, csv, os, time, random.
	6.	Execution: Command-line script. Produces all assets in out/ directory.

Purpose: automate end-to-end data acquisition and flashcard generation for study or internal directory reference.
